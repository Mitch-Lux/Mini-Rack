##Extra features
Below are a list of optional upgrades I have made to the rack since the basic framework was in place:

## Casters:
I used these Caster whheels for the bottom of my rack to allow for ease of movement

These can be attached to the join of the 2020T aluminium extrusion at the bottom of the rack, with 3 mounting points without having to make any alterations to the base of the rack (assuming your casters have a square mounting plate with holes in each corner).

## Handles for the rack:
I have attached a copy of the handles found at the link below to the front top and bottom, and rear top and bottom of the rack to enable easy movement on the casters.

These are then attached to the 2020T aluminium extrusion with M6 bolts passing into m6 t-nuts

## Side Pannels:
In my case the side pannels for the minirack are made of chipboard. 
"Why? you might ask, well.... I had some lying around because I was given some offcuts for free, and this seemed like a good time to use it.
I painted the chipboard white for my rack, after cutting it to dimension. Please bear in mind if you have changed the height (or dept) of the rack you built, or the dimensions will need to be changed. 

### Rational
Assenmbling the sides provides a number of options, for ease of access to the equipment inside my rack, I wanted side pannels that could be quickly and tool-lessly detatched, and re-attached. 
To make life easier I decided to mount the pannels to the outside of the 2020T extrusion as this way I wouldn't need to cut the pannels precisely, and I wouldn't need to worry about chamfering the top edge to allow it to swing out if I made it a friction fit. 
### Purchased Components
This requires the 90 degree joint blocks found in the BOM under "[Right angle brackets](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005007349855293.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.133.75971802QPCb3Y&gatewayAdapt=glo2vnm)"
Handily these come supplied with their own bolts and cage nuts, although in my case I didn't use them, because I lost them. I am not a smart man...
