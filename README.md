This is a page to track the build guidance for my mini rack project.

THis Project was inspired by the "[Project MINI RACK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GCIwLm3is&ab_channel=JeffGeerling)" from Jeff Geerling

Whilst I liked the idea of the mini rack that [GeeekPi 4U](https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Cabinet-Equipment-RackMate-Rackmount/dp/B0DPGZPTPP?crid=3MDBNMZKN66DE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RAZSJ_3XBtDA47t1Yst3waXCIZ0gZ7rk5FNsWG2LHUW4evmQTZRDmS8vUiYbaky0303sRwbjOOOjLF9I6Y2ZN04HuSn8hbM0Gvcy3b50BKrYbo2yuFiLbS9KhMHI3VqKzNcYIUYm404fd_yWgE9arp4-f9sav9oEEEVQHUi6mc4x5t2DkeyTY7x7iFnY60JL.sHB71PhfYyRkJJaVeY8cQydXEcl0LAnMNgVXhGFni08&dib_tag=se&keywords=rackmate+t0&qid=1736536448&sprefix=rackmate+t0,aps,130&sr=8-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=mmjjg-20&linkId=96cf07e1d07bd0da81caae2ab0ceefd0&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) I also didn't have the money to buy a rack, especially with such a small heigh in U's.

Most of my equipment is scavenged, pre-owned, gifted, or ebayed at the lowest price possible, meaning most of it will not fit in a single U of rack height. Due to this, I wanted to build a rack to take my homelab (read that as E-waste if you want) equipment and keep it somewhat organised. 

I know that there are several excellent 3D printed racks around, but I have my concerns about the amount of weight that some of them could take, and my 10 year old HP promicro isn't getting any lighter, so my requirements were:
Cheap: I want this build to be as cheap as possible  
Reliable: Structural elements of the rack should where possible be metal to allow for older heavier equipment. 
Accessible: If someone else sees this idea and wants to make their own, lets minimise the amount of tools and specialist equipment you need to put the rack body together. 
            As a caviat to this specialist shelves are't counted as technically they are not needed, and metal shelves available online could replace them for non-racked components where needed.
